It's a Hostler and student HelpDesk Portal, can post complaint and can 
## Why we need this?
Generally if a hostler has an issue e.g: Tubelight flicker, he has to find the respective person and inform this issue, on the same day that person have got a bunch of complaints which
is hard to remember or write it down that who have complained earlier and urgency. And there is no transparency among students, as he would solve issue very late sometimes, 
but have complained earlier or urget. So to overcome these cumborsome we have developed this **HelpDesk-Portal**
## Features
* Used authentication system
* Customized admin filters
* Post complaint with uploading Images
* Create a profile
* Automatically send birthday wishes to students through email
## Working
Every student gets username and password, using that he/she login to this portal which get them to home page where all unsolved issues are displayed with date that issue was posted
by whom and when. There we can post a new complaint with *title, description, rate urgency and location*. Then student can update their profile *e.g: DOB, adcademic details, contact
information etc...* A respective person have a admin username and password enabled django.admin where he can view entire database, issue need to be solved, solved issue etc.. and have
filter feature enabled. Once issue is solved it is automatically removed from home page. And if student update his DOB he get birthday wish through his email automatically triggered
by certain program.
